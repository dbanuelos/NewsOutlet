  <p>Imagine if every newspaper came with a mandatory T-shirt. Suddenly, that tabioid you paged through out of curiousity becomes part of your identity. You have to explain to friends that despite being a walking billboard, you don't actually argree with <i> The Wall Street Journal's</i> conservative editorials, or think <i>The New York Times</i> is too liberal but still covers the facts. Increasingly, you sick to outlets you unambiguously approve of, reinforming things you already believe.</p>
  <p>This is how Facebook imagines the future of news, and it's absurd.</p>
  <p>Since president-elect Donald Trump's campaign exposed deep rifts in the American electorate,<u style="color:deeppink"> people have criticized various aspects</u> of the Facebook "filter bubble", in which an incredibly popular platform surrounds users with content confirming thier worldview. Some of the problems with how Facebook sorts and shows news seem like <u style="color:deeppink">genuine mistakes</u>, and others seem at least malleable. But the issue isn't just algorithms. It's a collision between the social interactions that Facebook is designed to simulate, and the information-gathering that it's now used for. Facebook is a news platform, but its most ubiquitous form of interaction is designed to discourage exploration: the Like.</p>
